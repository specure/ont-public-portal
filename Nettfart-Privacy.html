        <p>The full web version is available at <a href="https://nettfart.no/en/personvernerklaering">Nettfart.no</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When you use Nettfart, you give Nkom access to various types of information about your internet connection. Information that can be linked to you as a person is called "personal information". This also applies to information that can be indirectly linked to you, such as IP address.</p>
<p>Nkom is responsible for the processing all of personal data in Nettfart. The data controller has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that all processing and handling of personal data takes place in accordance with current legislation. When you allow us to disclose personal information to others, they will have an independent responsibility for further processing of the information, see further section 4.</p>
<p>Below you can read what information we collect, how we do it, what we use it for and what rights you have.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-do-we-store-about-you-">What information do we store about you?</h2>
<p>The information that is collected and stored is various measurement data that is stored in a database that Nkom controls. The measurement data that is collected is retrieved from the web browser and from Nettfart measurement servers. The following information is collected and/or stored via Nettfart:</p>
<p>Visitor’s  information; Information required in order for you to be able to see your own measurement result. The access to this information can be controlled by the user by stating their acceptance to the Cookie policy. This information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test ID (Open Test ID) *</li></ul>
<p>Speed ​​; How fast and reliable your internet connection is, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data connection speed in both directions (download / upload) *</li><li>Response time for data connection (ping) *</li></ul>
<p>Technology; What technology and supplier do you use when conducting the test, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network operator *</li><li>IP version *</li><li>IP address</li></ul>
<p>Location; </p>
<ul>
<li>Time Zone *</li></ul>
<p>The data marked with asterisk ( <em> ) are transmitted; i.e. published and visible to everyone. The data is made freely available to the general public as Open Data for information, use and dissemination.
Data not marked with ( </em> ) are not transmitted (public) and shall not be disclosed. This data shall be accessed by Nkom only.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-information-used-for-">What is the information used for?</h2>
<p>Registration, storage and use of personal information in Nettfart has different purposes. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>In order for the user, both historically and / or in the present, to be able to check that the speed and quality of the line is in accordance with what the user is promised by his internet service provider.</li><li>So that all users of Nettfart, both historically and in the present, can compare their own speed with other users in the same geographical area.</li><li>So that Nkom and third parties, such as public authorities, owners of infrastructure and the general public, both historically and in the present, can get an overview of how internet connectivity for Nettfart user’s have developed.</li></ol>
<h2 id="do-we-share-your-personal-information-with-others-">Do we share your personal information with others?</h2>
<p>If you agree to share, your personal information may be shared with other third parties. However, the IP address and UserID will only be processed by you and Nkom, and any suppliers we use. Such information will not be shared with third parties unless otherwise provided by law. Otherwise, we will, as necessary, share and/or publish other registered measurement data (marked with an asterisk *) in line with the described purposes.</p>
<p>Sharing with third parties other than public authorities and infrastructure owners is limited so that neither IP address or Test ID are disclosed.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-do-we-store-your-personal-information-">How long do we store your personal information?</h2>
<p>We do not store personal data any longer and to a greater extent than is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the processing unless required by law.</p>
<p>The main rule is that personal information is stored for 6 months before it is then anonymised. When the measurement data is anonymised, there will no longer be a link between them and the IP address and the Test ID. The measurement data will then also not be counted as personal information.</p>
<h2 id="you-decide-if-and-how-long-we-will-process-your-personal-information">You decide if and how long we will process your personal information</h2>
<p>The processing basis for the processing of personal data in Nettfart is the Privacy Ordinance, Article 6, No. 1, letter a, i.e consent. You must therefore give express consent to the processing of personal data before you are allowed to use Nettfart. This is done by clicking on the "Start test" at the main page.</p>
<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by sending an email to nettfart@nkom.no. Your Test ID and IP address and any geographical position of the measurement will then be deleted so that the measurement data can no longer be linked to you. The other measurement data will remain stored in Nkom's database for both internal and external use. </p>
<p>Withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legality of the processing of personal data that occurred before you withdrew the consent.</p>
<h2 id="your-personal-information-is-stored-in-a-safe-way">Your personal information is stored in a safe way</h2>
<p>The database is stored on Nettfart’s servers which are installed in a room with strict physical access control. Access to the database is secured with a username and password. With remote access over the Internet by the logged in user, the data is end-to-end encrypted in the transmission from Nettfart servers and to the display on the logged in computer. It is also logged which users log in to the database so that an overview and history of who has had access to measurement data in the database is ensured. The database of measurement data is regularly backed up and stored in a safe place.</p>
<h2 id="your-rights">Your rights</h2>
<h3 id="contact-information">Contact information</h3>
<p>You can exercise your rights by sending us an e-mail to nettfart@nkom.no or a letter to:</p>
<p>National Communications Authority
PO Box 93
4791 Lillesand</p>
<p>You are entitled to an answer without undue delay, and within one month at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="correction-of-collected-information">Correction of collected information</h3>
<p>If you discover that we process information about you that is incorrect, you can demand correction. You must be able to prove that the information is incorrect and what is correct.</p>
<p>If your personal information has been corrected and we have previously handed over your information to someone else, we normally have a duty to notify the recipient or recipients of the correction. However, this only applies as far as possible and does not involve a disproportionate effort. You also have the right to know who has received the information.</p>
<h3 id="deletion-of-personal-data">Deletion of personal data</h3>
<p>We automatically anonymize all personal information after six months. Anonymisation will be considered deletion.</p>
<p>In certain situations, you can ask us to delete information about yourself before six months have passed. As the basis for processing personal data about you is your consent, it will normally be sufficient to withdraw the consent to have personal data deleted. Exceptions are conceivable if continued storage is necessary to fulfill a legal requirement, storage is necessary for statistical purposes or that we must have the information to be able to defend a legal requirement later.</p>
<h3 id="limitation-of-processing-of-personal-data">Limitation of processing of personal data</h3>
<p>In some situations, you may also ask us to limit the processing of information about you. In that case, your personal information may be stored but not used for anything. You may require limitation of the processing of personal data in the following cases:</p>
<p>You believe the information stored about you is incorrect. While we are checking the information, the processing may be limited for a period of time.
You have used your right to protest, and we are deciding whether to accept your objection.</p>
<p>You can also use the right of restriction to prevent your personal information from being deleted. This applies in these cases:</p>
<p>Personal data is processed illegally and must be deleted, but you want their use to be restricted instead of being deleted.
Nkom will delete the information because it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. You need the information to establish, assert or defend a legal claim and therefore want it stored.</p>
<p>When the processing of personal data is limited, we store the information, but do not use it for anything without your consent. There are a few exceptions, including if we need the information to establish, assert or defend a legal claim or to protect another person's rights.</p>
<h3 id="data-portability">Data portability</h3>
<p>Because we process information about you on the basis of consent, you can ask us to transfer information about you to you, or another data controller. This implies that you contact us and can verify your information. The information must be provided in a machine-readable and commonly used file format. You may require that your personal information be transferred directly to a new service provider whenever technically possible.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-complain-about-our-processing-of-personal-data">You can complain about our processing of personal data</h3>
<p>We hope you will let us know if you think we do not comply with the rules in the Personal Data Act. You can then send an e-mail to Nkom's e-mail address nettfart@nkom.no or send us a letter.</p>
<p>You can also complain about our processing of personal data. You do this to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, but the complaint will be forwarded to the Ministry of Local Government and Modernization, which will establish a set inspection to process the case.</p>
